Although the organelles and large molecules in a cell can be visualized with microscopes, understanding how these components function requires a detailed biochemical analysis. Most biochemical procedures require obtaining large numbers of cells and then physically disrupting them to isolate their components. If the sample is a piece of tissue, composed of different types of cells, heterogeneous cell populations will be mixed together. To obtain as much information as possible about an individual cell type, biologists have developed ways of dissociating cells from tissues and separating the various types. These manipulations result in a relatively homogeneous population of cells that can then be analyzed either directly or after their number has been increased by allowing the cells to proliferate as a pure culture. Cells Can Be Isolated from a Tissue Suspension and Separated into Different Types.
