Although the organelles and large molecules in a cell can be visualized with microscopes, understanding how these components function requires a detailed biochemical analysis. Most biochemical procedures require obtaining large numbers of cells and then disrupting them to isolate their components. If the sample is a piece of tissue, composed of different types of cells, heterogeneous cell populations will be mixed together.
