The first step in isolating cells of a uniform type from a tissue that contains a mixture of cell types is to disrupt the extracellular matrix that holds the cells together. The best yields of viable dissociated cells are usually obtained from fetal or neonatal tissues. The tissue sample is typically treated with proteolytic enzymes (such as trypsin and collagenase) to digest proteins in the extracellular matrix and with agents (such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, or EDTA) that bind, or chelate, the Ca 2+ on which cell-cell adhesion depends. The tissue can then be teased apart into single living cells by gentle agitation.Knowledge that these two proteins in yeast correspond to two domains in a single bacterial protein means that they are likely to be functionally associated, and probably work together in a protein complex. Whether a given oligosaccharide remains high-mannose or is processed is determined largely by its position on the protein.
